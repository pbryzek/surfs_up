# Bootcamp: UCB-VIRT-DATA-PT-03-2020-U-B-TTH

### Bootcamp Challenge #9 - 5/10/2020
Bootcamp Challenge 9: Module surfs_up

### Jupyter Notebooks Created
- [climate_analysis](climate_analysis.ipynb)

### Challenge Description
The goals of this challenge are for you to:
- Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
- Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
- Compare your findings between the month of June and December.
- Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
- Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Methodology: 
Utilized SQLAlchemy ORM to upload the hawaii.sqlite DB into code objects. With an initial start_date of 2017-08-23, using code to get a date of exactly 365 days prior to the start_date
